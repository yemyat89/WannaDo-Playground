##WannaDo Android App

As a learning expereince, I created this app to understand concepts in Android development. The motivation is I need some form of list that keeps reminding me of what I want to do in a certain period. For example, I am happy when I have multiple things to do in my mind but sometimes I have to focus on one. With this app, I can create a list of those things I am interested and keep a focus. While focusing on one activity, I can touch the counter to remind myself of how much I have been doing that activity. By clicking one activity, I can see the detail information and some basic statistics. In addition the history of the activity will be shown per request (by clicking View History).

Some screenshots are shown below.
